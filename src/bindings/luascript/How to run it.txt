Note: for all platforms you will need to aply the sql patch in sql folder

-----------
ON WINDOWS:
-----------
1.you need to download boost (boost.org)
2.extract boost and copy /boost dir ... ( you need to have \src\bindings\luascript\boost\cast.hpp in this order )
3.Open your mangos-project with vs2003 
4.remove script project
5.File->add project->add existing project and navigate to luascript.vcproj
6.copy the contents of the lua-scripts folder to the folder where your mangosd.exe is run from
7.you are ready ... compile and run ... :)

-----------
ON LINUX:
-----------
Still testing ...

Warning: This will remove your existing scripts library ( better back it up )

1.you need to download boost (boost.org)
2.extract boost and copy /boost dir ... ( you need to have \src\bindings\luascript\boost\cast.hpp in this order )

3.
cd /to/your/mangos/src/dir
cd ./src/bindings
svn co http://mangos-luascript.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/bindings/luascript/ luascript
svn cleanup universal
rm -rf universal
ln -s ./luascript ./universal

4.now is the hard part
cd /to/your/mangos/src/dir
./configure <with your config options>
make
#do this as su-user
su -c "make install"

5.copy the contents of the lua-scripts folder to the folder where your run mangosd from
Example: if you run it like bin/mangosd, put it before the 'bin' folder

To start mangos:
cd /where/your/mangosd/executeble is/
